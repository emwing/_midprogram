A repo for my MCAD Fall 2017 MidProgram Review Portfolio.

This portfolio site showcases some of my strongest work from the Interactive Design and Marketing post baccalaureate courses. Pieces included in the portfolio include sample sites and marketing examples. The portfolio site itself also served as a show piece. At the time of its creation, I was in the midst of learning JavaScript and Jquery.

This site and its show pieces were presented to a panel of three people, from various web and design industries, as well as the program director. The goal was to describe each projects parameters, the thought process behind how those parameters were met, and what was learned from the overall experience.
